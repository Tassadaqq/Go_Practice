If we are having a text file of really small size for example we have a 2kb then we can use reading at once as it will consume less space in primary memory

where if we have a really large text file of the size 2.5 gb we may use buffer reading to read the file line by line this will be more effective and there is less cost of primary memory.whereas reading all at once is going to take a lot of space
